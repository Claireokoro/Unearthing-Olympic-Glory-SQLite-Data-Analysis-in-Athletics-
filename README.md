## Introduction
In this project, we explore and analyze the athletics and Olympics datasets using SQL queries. We aim to answer various questions related to athlete performance and country success in the Olympics.

## Dataset
The project utilizes two datasets: `athletics.csv` and `olympics.csv` which were obtained from Kaggle. The datasets contain information about athletes, events, countries, and medals won.

## Queries
The project addresses the following questions through SQL queries:
1. [Top 5 Athletes with Most Gold Medals](#top-5-athletes-with-most-gold-medals)
2. [Top 5 Most Successful Countries](#top-5-most-successful-countries)
3. [Total Gold Medals by Each Country](#total-gold-medals-by-each-country)
4. [Country with Most Bronze Medals](#country-with-most-bronze-medals)
5. [United States' Most Successful Sport/Event](#us-most-successful-sport)
6. [India's Olympic Hockey Medals](#indias-olympic-hockey-medals)

## Results
Summarize the key findings and insights you've gained from the data analysis. Include any visualizations or relevant statistics that support your conclusions.

## Instructions
